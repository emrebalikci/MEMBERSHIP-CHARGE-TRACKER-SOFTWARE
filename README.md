# MEMBERSHIP-CHARGE-TRACKER-SOFTWARE
Let’s assume that your customer has a social club. He needs keep track of maintenance charge paid
by the members of the club. In the club, just for the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that there are 15
members who pay charge. Thus, he wants to enter maintenance charge information for 2015 year
and see the list of charge status for a specific month. He puts a “+” sign for those members who pay
while he puts a “ - ” sign for those members who do not pay the charge for that month.

Note that only + and – signs are allowed as operators. If he enters whatever else as operator, your
program should throw an specific exception named “IllegalOperatorException” that extends
Exception class. In this application, your task is to write an membership charge tracker application
with an exception handling mechanism in Java for him.

Please, create a menu (either GUI or Console ) and ask for a selection from him within an appropriate
Java application class. According to his choice, your program should perform the related task.The
tasks are below.

    1- enter montly charge for all members
    2- list all member’s montly payment info
    3- exit from the application.
In your test class , create fifteen members directly without asking him just for testing purpose.

Note that you are supposed to use arrays to store members’ payment information. Furthermore,
you are required to decide about possible exceptions by yourself and handle them. Also, you are
supposed to create IllegalOperatorException class.

In your implementation, use good software engineering and object-oriented programming practices
and use a UML Class diagram reflecting your design before your implementation.Moreover, do not2
forget to do validity checking for parameters for each classes.Furthermore, you are required to
decide about possible exceptions by yourself and handle them.
